[LOSTFILES]
;Define here any files you want to show up in the "Lost files" branch of the recovery tree
;You must provide a file signature between 2 and 8 byte length, located at the beginning of the file
;Also provide an expression determining the size of the file. You can reference any byte of the
;file's first sector.
;Example: Help-Files
;  Help files start with the signature $3F,$5F,$03,$00.
;  Found lost Help files will get the extention HLP in the recovery tree
;  The size will be determined by the double word found at position 12 in the first sector [12,4]
;NOTE:
;  Many files types, e.g. ZIP-files, do not contain their length in their header. However, you can
;  specify a length large enough to cover the size of the ZIPs you want to recover. Many applications
;  (such as WINZIP) are not bothered by files that are longer than in their original state.
